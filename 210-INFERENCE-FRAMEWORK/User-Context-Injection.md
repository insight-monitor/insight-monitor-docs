## How context reaches the model
User-defined context is serialized into a structured block appended to the system prompt before every inference cycle.

## Example: Full-time software developer

USER CONTEXT:
- Role: Senior Backend Developer
- Industry: Fintech
- Current objectives:
- Deploy payment microservice (priority: high)
- Refactor authentication module (priority: medium)
- Code review for team PRs (priority: medium)
- Working hours: 09:00 - 18:00
- Meeting blocks: 10:00-11:00 daily standup, 14:00-15:00 sprint planning (Tue/Thu)
- App classifications:
- VS Code / IntelliJ -> work-critical
- Postman -> work-critical
- Slack -> work-critical (team communication)
- GitHub / GitLab -> work-critical
- YouTube -> personal (except technical tutorials)
- Stack Overflow / documentation -> work-critical
- Environment: Remote work, single monitor
- Break periods: 12:00-13:00 lunch, 15-min breaks at 11:00 and 16:00

## Effect on inference
The model uses this context to weight evidence:

- Slack message activity during work hours → **team collaboration** (not distraction)
- VS Code + Postman + terminal simultaneously → **active development / debugging**
- YouTube with "tutorial" in title → **work-relevant research**
- Browser open on GitHub during work hours → **code review task**
- YouTube with music or entertainment content → **personal / flagged as break**
- No activity during 12:00-13:00 → **scheduled lunch** (not unproductive idle)
- Context switch from IDE to Slack to documentation → **task coordination** (not distraction)

## Context freshness
User context is cached and reused. When objectives change or projects shift, the user must update their context to maintain inference accuracy. Stale context (calling a past project as current) degrades classification quality.
