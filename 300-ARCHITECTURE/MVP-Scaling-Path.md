# MVP Scaling Path

This document describes what the MVP does NOT do yet — but what the architecture *preserves* so that future additions don't require rewrites.

## Architecture Decisions That Survive Scaling

### 1. Decoupled layers via HTTP

The three layers (Capture, API, Dashboard) communicate over HTTP. This means:
- The capture agent can be replaced (e.g., Electron app with more UI) without touching backend
- The dashboard can be swapped for a mobile app without changing inference
- Multiple capture agents can post to the same API instance (multi-device support)

### 2. Pydantic models as the schema contract

All data structures (`RawEvent`, `SessionContext`, `IntentRecord`) are defined as Pydantic models in a single place. The TypeScript types in the frontend mirror them. When the schema evolves:
- Add a field to Pydantic → auto-generated OpenAPI spec → regenerate TypeScript types
- No manual synchronization between Python and TypeScript

### 3. Configuration-driven capture

The capture agent reads all parameters from environment variables (interval, paths, thresholds). Adding new signal types post-MVP:
- Add the capture module
- Add the handler in `agent.py`
- No hardcoded values to untangle

### 4. Prompt as the product

The inference prompt is a single template file. Changing classification categories, adding new use cases, or tuning for a different environment requires only prompt changes — not code changes. The MVP prompt has a Riwi mode; future modes (BPO, compliance, personal productivity) are additional prompt templates.

## Post-MVP Roadmap

### Immediate (Weeks 3-4 after MVP)

| Feature | Why |
|---|---|
| Browser extension for full URLs | More accurate URL context than tab titles |
| Multi-tenant isolation | Need to serve > 1 customer |
| WebSocket-based real-time updates | Better dashboard experience |
| Confidence model refinement | Calibrate confidence scores against user feedback |

### Medium-term (Months 2-3)

| Feature | Why |
|---|---|
| LanceDB + semantic search | Query historical sessions in natural language |
| Anomaly detection engine | Rule-based + statistical anomaly on URL/domain patterns |
| Dynamic session catalog | Auto-discover workflows from aggregated data |
| Report generation (PDF/CSV) | Deliverable outputs for stakeholders |
| macOS capture agent | Broaden market reach |

### Long-term (Months 4-6)

| Feature | Why |
|---|---|
| GUI installer (MSI/DEB/DMG) | Non-technical deployment |
| Centralized management server | Fleet-wide configuration and monitoring |
| Celery worker for async inference | Background processing for report generation |
| User contestability UI | Feedback loop for improving accuracy |
| Integration APIs (webhooks) | Connect to Slack, Jira, HR systems |

## What NOT to Preserve

Some MVP decisions are intentionally temporary:

| Decision | Replace With | When |
|---|---|---|
| SQLite | PostgreSQL or SQLite with replication | Multi-user or multi-instance deployment |
| Gemini Flash | Domain-fine-tuned model or smaller local model | Inference volume or privacy requirements grow |
| HTTP polling | WebSocket | Real-time dashboard adopted by supervisors |
| Single process FastAPI | Docker Compose + multiple services | Need to scale API, inference, and storage independently |
| CLI agent startup | Systemd service / Windows service | Agent must survive reboots and user logouts |
